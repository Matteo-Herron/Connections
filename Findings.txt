Findings

When we took averages of cosine similarity between each answer word and each hint word, these were the results. 
Example : blue things: sky, water, blueberry, lapiz.
average(similarity(sky, blue), similarity(sky, things)) - do that for each answer word, and then average all averages.

yellow = [0.19836305945999128]
green = [0.13248263527833665]
blue = [0.12387551615784545]
purple = [0.07010725111314633]

These results would indicate a clear decrease in semantic similarity as the categories get harder.


However, we realized that a hint might contain words like "like" or "contains," that have little semantic meaning, and so they take the
average down. So, we ran it again, only averaging the max of an answer word with each hint word.
Same example set as above.
max(similarity(sky, blue), similarity(sky, things)) - do that for each answer word, and then average all averages.


yellow = [0.2431283732106111]
green = [0.14841589288679585]
blue = [0.18585744433468743]
purple = [0.13828573846454828]

These results are interesting, and show that as opposed to the findings from the first test:
blue category hints contain words that are more semantically similar to the answer words, 
but overall they contain more semantically-meaningless filler words than green category hints,
which also contain less semantically similar words to answer words.



Now, we decided to compare answer words with each other semantically. 
Same example set.
average(similarity(sky, water), similarity(sky, blueberry), similarity(sky, lapiz), etc.), then average with previous average.

yellow = [0.24653310919713065]
green = [0.18712535338497988]
blue = [0.13417580448129662]
purple = [0.1293238030682114]

This shows a cleare decrease in semantic similarity as the categories get harder, again.


This time, we ran it again, but computed the average of the max semantic similarity within answers. We found:

yellow = [0.42431658718221643]
green = [0.35948243913244715]
blue = [0.27723833930987407]
purple = [0.294626961236084]

The outlier here would be purple being higher than blue, and that would track with the blue category sometimes being
harder or more distantly related than the purple category, in our experience.



In conclusion, it is safe to say that answer word - answer word similarities and answer word - hint word similarities decrease as 
the category gets harder, and this may come in handy in creating rules for our version of connections.
